      <p class="text-lg text-lime-500 px-5 sm:px-10 md:px-20 lg:px-200 text-justify">
        Did you know small business owners often spend 4-6 hours a week on bookkeeping and
        administrative tasks? That's about 200-300 hours a year—time you could be using to focus on
        what you love. Imagine what you could do with those extra hours: spend more time with
        family, take a long-awaited vacation, or invest in growing your business. Let me help you
        reclaim that time by handling your bookkeeping needs. At Green Apple Bookkeeping, we blend
        professionalism with approachability to empower small business owners with organized and
        accurate financial systems. Drawing from a background in education, I specialize in putting
        complex accounting practices into clear, understandable language. Just as an educator sets
        students up for success, I take the time to set up efficient, tailored systems that help
        businesses thrive. By getting to know my clients and their goals, I implement bookkeeping
        solutions that save time, bring clarity, and enable growth—both in business and in personal
        life. With monthly and quarterly reporting, I provide insights into your financial trends,
        helping you make informed decisions that boost profitability and optimize cash flow. And
        when tax season arrives, your books will be in order, making the process smoother, more
        cost-effective, and less stressful. Organization is key to success, and I ensure every
        transaction has a place, so you and your financial team can access the right information
        when you need it. Whether it's clean-ups, catch-ups, monthly categorization and
        reconciliations, or financial reporting, I'll make sure everything is where it should be.
        Choosing my services means more than just getting a bookkeeper; it means gaining a partner
        committed to your growth and success.
